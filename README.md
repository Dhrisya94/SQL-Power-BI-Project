## PIZZA SALES PERFORMANCE (SQL & POWER BI)
# Project Objective
To design and develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides actionable insights into pizza sales performance. The goal is to analyze key metrics such as total sales, sales by pizza type and category, top-selling and low-performing products, customer ordering patterns, and peak sales times. This dashboard will support data-driven decision-making by identifying trends, uncovering sales opportunities, and optimizing inventory, staffing, and marketing strategies.

# KPI's Requirements
We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specially, we want to calculate the following metrics:

Total Revenue: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.

Average Order Value: The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.

Total Pizza Sold: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.

Total Orders: The total number of orders placed.

Average pizzas per orders: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.
# Chart Requirements
We would like to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends. We have identified the following requirements for creating charts:

Daily Trend for Total Orders: Create a bar chart that displays the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period. This chart will help us identify any patterns or fluctuations in order volumes on a daily basis.

Monthly Trends for Total Orders: Create a line chart that illustrates the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day. This chart will allow us to identify peak hours or periods of high orders activity.

Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category: Create a pie chart that shows the distribution of sales across different pizza categories. This chart will provide insights into the popularity of various pizza categories and their contribution to overall sales.

Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size: Generate a pie chart that represents the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes. This chart will help us understand customer preference for pizza size and their impact on sales.

Total Pizza Sold by Pizza Category: Create a funnel chart that presents the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category. This chart will allow us to compare the sales performance of different pizza categories.

Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity and Total orders: Create a bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on the Revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders. This chart will help us identify the most popular pizza options.

Bottom 5 Worst Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity and Total orders: Create a bar chart highlighting the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on the Revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders. This chart will enable us identify the underperforming or less popular pizza options.
